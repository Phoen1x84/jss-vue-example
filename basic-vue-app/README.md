# Basic Application Demo

Demonstrates an very basic JSS Application written using Vue.

Consult the primary JSS documentation at https://jss.sitecore.net for the latest documentation on JSS.

# Setup

**First** run `npm i` to install dependencies.

## Disconnected Sitecore-less Development

Use `npm run start` to run a local development server. Sitecore is not required to be installed, and content data is pulled from static local sources.

Disconnected development is appropriate when no Sitecore instance is available, or when frontend developers do not wish to run a local copy of Sitecore.
